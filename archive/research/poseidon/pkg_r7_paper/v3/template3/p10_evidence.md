## 10. Evidence

Everything in this section is evidence produced by us. None of it enters `success_probability` or the bound of section 9, and none is a lower bound on the probability of `E_c`.

### 10.1 Executed full-scale outcomes at r = 3, 4, 5

| run | degree of F | m | centres tried (in order) | outcome per centre (`deg G`) | successes | operations N (executed) | time_log2 | memory (bytes) | threads, wall |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| r = 3, earlier program | 5^9 | 976,562 | 1 (fixed) | c=1: 1 | 1 | 317,054,280,703 | 30.08182 | 250,386,180 | 1 thread, 3,202.9 s |
| r = 4, earlier program | 5^10 | 4,882,812 | 1, 2 (fixed) | c=1: 0 (no usable root); c=2: 1 | 1 | 3,992,419,235,666 | 33.63159 | 1,231,371,140 | 6 threads, 13,030.2 s |
| r = 5, earlier program | 5^11 | 24,414,062 | 1 (fixed) | c=1: 1 | 1 | 9,205,778,231,873 | 34.73925 | 5,604,188,884 | 13 threads, 22,048.3 s |

These are the executed entries of the same construction with the centres 1, 2, ... in place of coin draws (their operation counts are the instrumented totals of those runs, thread charges included). Usable roots appeared at three of the four centres tried; each run stops at its first success.

The collisions found (each is a pair of distinct canonical `(nk, rho)` with equal digests at its own round count, accepted by the organizer's digest function when the entry was filed):

### 10.2 Scope

One trial at r = @@R@@ needs @@TRIAL_MEM@@ of live memory and @@TRIAL_WORK@@. The claim is the premise `H-GEOM-w@@W@@` with the reduction of section 9.2; the executed centres at r = 3, 4, 5 are context.
