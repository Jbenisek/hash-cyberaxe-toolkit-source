## 4. Construction: the message from eight words, in three levels

The construction places the six constants of 3.2 where Lemma H needs them and
gives Y4, the b output of C0, a prescribed value y. Its input is eight free
words. Six form an *outer step*: C0.c1 and C0.d1 (the third and the second
value of the round-1 call C0), D3.d1 (the second value of the round-0 call D3),
S15 and S9 (words of the state S) and the message word w5. The seventh is X2, a
word of the state X; with it the six are a *context*. The eighth is y. X3, X7,
X11, X15 are the constants, w4 = W4, w13 = W13 and w14 = w15 = 0.

*Names.* TAG.a1, TAG.d1, TAG.c1, TAG.b1 are the first to fourth value of the
call TAG (Section 2); its outputs carry the names of the state S, X or Y they
are written to; entry c66f230d writes vc, vd, vb, va for C0.c1, C0.d1, C0.b1,
C0.a1. Arithmetic is modulo 2^32. The submitted program has steps O and M in
`outer` and `middle` ("Step S1" of entry c66f230d), step Y in `member`, step T
in `trial`.

**Step O (the outer step; 29 lines).**

    K2, forwards from w5; its first four values are constants:
        K2.a1 = IV[2] + IV[6] + W4;   K2.d1 = ROR(55 XOR K2.a1, 16)
        K2.c1 = IV[2] + K2.d1;   K2.b1 = ROR(IV[6] XOR K2.c1, 12)
        S2 = K2.a1 + K2.b1 + w5;   S14 = ROR(K2.d1 XOR S2, 8)
        S10 = K2.c1 + S14;   S6 = ROR(K2.b1 XOR S10, 7)
    D3 with w14 = w15 = 0, from D3.d1, its inputs S9, S14, its output X3:
        D3.a1 = ROL(D3.d1,16) XOR S14;   D3.c1 = S9 + D3.d1
        D3.b1 = X3 - D3.a1;   S4 = ROL(D3.b1,12) XOR D3.c1
        S3 = D3.a1 - S4;   X14 = ROR(D3.d1 XOR X3, 8)
        X9 = D3.c1 + X14;   X4 = ROR(D3.b1 XOR X9, 7)
    K3, backwards from its outputs S3, S15:
        K3.d1 = ROL(S15,8) XOR S3;   K3.c1 = IV[3] + K3.d1
        K3.b1 = ROR(IV[7] XOR K3.c1, 12);   S11 = K3.c1 + S15
        S7 = ROR(K3.b1 XOR S11, 7);   K3.a1 = ROL(K3.d1,16) XOR 11
        w6 = K3.a1 - IV[3] - IV[7];   w7 = S3 - K3.a1 - K3.b1
    C0, third assignment and fourth value; D2, backwards from X7, X8, S7:
        X8 = C0.c1 - C0.d1;   C0.b1 = ROR(X4 XOR C0.c1, 12)
        D2.b1 = ROL(X7,7) XOR X8;   D2.c1 = ROL(D2.b1,12) XOR S7
        X13 = X8 - D2.c1

**Step M (the middle step; 21 lines, from X2).**

    D2, rest:
        D2.a1 = X2 - D2.b1 - W13;   D2.d1 = ROL(X13,8) XOR X2
        S13 = ROL(D2.d1,16) XOR D2.a1;   S8 = D2.c1 - D2.d1
        w12 = D2.a1 - S2 - S7
    K1, backwards from its outputs S9, S13:
        K1.c1 = S9 - S13;   K1.d1 = K1.c1 - IV[1]
        K1.a1 = ROL(K1.d1,16);   K1.b1 = ROR(IV[5] XOR K1.c1, 12)
        S1 = ROL(S13,8) XOR K1.d1;   S5 = ROR(K1.b1 XOR S9, 7)
        w2 = K1.a1 - IV[1] - IV[5];   w3 = S1 - K1.a1 - K1.b1
    K0, backwards from its outputs S4, S8:
        K0.b1 = ROL(S4,7) XOR S8;   K0.c1 = ROL(K0.b1,12) XOR IV[4]
        K0.d1 = K0.c1 - IV[0];   K0.a1 = ROL(K0.d1,16)
        S12 = S8 - K0.c1;   S0 = ROL(S12,8) XOR K0.d1
        w0 = K0.a1 - IV[0] - IV[4];   w1 = S0 - K0.a1 - K0.b1

**Step Y (the member; 10 lines, from y and the outer step, without X2).**

    C0, backwards from its b output y:
        Y8 = ROL(y,7) XOR C0.b1;   Y12 = Y8 - C0.c1
        Y0 = ROL(Y12,8) XOR C0.d1;   C0.a1 = Y0 - C0.b1 - w6
        X12 = ROL(C0.d1,16) XOR C0.a1
    D1, backwards from its outputs X11, X12, with its inputs S6, S11:
        D1.c1 = X11 - X12;   D1.b1 = ROR(S6 XOR D1.c1, 12)
        X6 = ROR(D1.b1 XOR X11, 7);   D1.d1 = D1.c1 - S11
        X1 = ROL(X12,8) XOR D1.d1

**Step T (the four words w8..w11; 12 lines).**

    C0, its first assignment:
        X0 = C0.a1 - X4 - w2
    D0, backwards from its outputs X0, X15:
        D0.d1 = ROL(X15,8) XOR X0;   D0.c1 = S10 + D0.d1
        X10 = D0.c1 + X15;   D0.b1 = ROR(S5 XOR D0.c1, 12)
        X5 = ROR(D0.b1 XOR X10, 7);   D0.a1 = ROL(D0.d1,16) XOR S15
        w8 = D0.a1 - S0 - S5;   w9 = X0 - D0.a1 - D0.b1
    D1, rest:
        D1.a1 = ROL(D1.d1,16) XOR S12;   w10 = D1.a1 - S1 - S6
        w11 = X1 - D1.a1 - D1.b1

**Step S2.** w4' = W4' and w5' = w5 + W4 - W4', all modulo 2^32. For the
constants of 3.2 that is w5' = w5 + fffffff8, the same as w5 - 8.

**Step S3.** A is the first 55 bytes of the little-endian encoding of w0..w15;
B is the first 63 bytes of that of the same words with w4', w5' for w4, w5.

*Round 1, forwards (24 lines).* The tests of 6.3 read these values of round 1
of message A. Y3 and Y11 are the constants of Fact P for w4 = W4, and Y4 = y.

    C1, the call G(X1, X5, X9, X13; w3, w10):
        C1.a1 = X1 + X5 + w3;   C1.d1 = ROR(X13 XOR C1.a1, 16)
        C1.c1 = X9 + C1.d1;   C1.b1 = ROR(X5 XOR C1.c1, 12)
        Y1 = C1.a1 + C1.b1 + w10;   Y13 = ROR(C1.d1 XOR Y1, 8)
        Y9 = C1.c1 + Y13;   Y5 = ROR(C1.b1 XOR Y9, 7)
    C2, the call G(X2, X6, X10, X14; w7, w0):
        C2.a1 = X2 + X6 + w7;   C2.d1 = ROR(X14 XOR C2.a1, 16)
        C2.c1 = X10 + C2.d1;   C2.b1 = ROR(X6 XOR C2.c1, 12)
        Y2 = C2.a1 + C2.b1 + w0;   Y14 = ROR(C2.d1 XOR Y2, 8)
        Y10 = C2.c1 + Y14;   Y6 = ROR(C2.b1 XOR Y10, 7)
    E1 on A, with its c input Y11; third and fourth assignment in one line:
        E1.a1 = Y1 + Y6 + w12;   E1.d1 = ROR(Y12 XOR E1.a1, 16)
        E1.b1 = ROR(Y6 XOR (Y11 + E1.d1), 12);   E1.a2 = E1.a1 + E1.b1 + w5
    E3 on A, with its a input Y3 and w15 = 0; first and second in one line:
        E3.h1 = ROR(Y14 XOR (Y3 + Y4), 16);   E3.g1 = Y9 + E3.h1
        E3.f1 = ROR(Y4 XOR E3.g1, 12);   E3.e2 = (Y3 + Y4) + E3.f1 + w8

These 24 lines define nothing of the message. E3.h1, E3.g1, E3.f1, E3.e2 are
the h1, g1, f1, e2 of 6.2, and the word z of Lemma A is C2.d1 XOR Y2.

**The order and the levels.** The 29 + 21 + 10 + 12 + 24 = 96 lines above are
taken in the printed order. Lines of step O are *outer*, of step M *middle*, of
step Y *table* lines; the 12 lines of step T and the 24 of round 1 are the 36
*trial* lines. Table C gives each call's eight assignments by their left sides.

The inputs, message words and outputs of the eleven calls are those of Section
1 for n = 55: Ki (i = 0..3) maps (IV[i], IV[i+4], IV[i], d) with d = 0, 0, 55,
11 to (S[i], S[i+4], S[i+8], S[i+12]); D0..D3 map (S0, S5, S10, S15), (S1, S6,
S11, S12), (S2, S7, S8, S13), (S3, S4, S9, S14), and C0..C2 map (X0, X4, X8,
X12), (X1, X5, X9, X13), (X2, X6, X10, X14), to the X and the Y words of the
same indices.

**Lemma T2.** (a) *Triangular.* In the printed order every line assigns a name
that no earlier line assigns and that is neither one of the eight words nor a
constant, and it reads only constants, the eight words (the eighth under the
name Y4 in the lines of round 1) and names of earlier lines. A line of step O
reads no word other than the six of the outer step, a line of step M reads
neither y nor a name of step Y, and a line of step Y reads neither X2 nor a
name of step M. Every line is one assignment of one call, solved for the name
on its left; the two exceptions are the lines for E1.b1 and for E3.h1, each of
which is two assignments with the first substituted into the second (c1 = Y11 +
E1.d1 and e1 = Y3 + Y4 + w15), and the line for E3.e2 uses the same e1. By
Table C the 96 lines are, each exactly once: the eight assignments of each of
the eleven calls K0..K3, D0..D3, C0..C2, with the inputs and the message words
of Section 1 for block length 55, with w4 = W4, w13 = W13, w14 = w15 = 0, and
with the constants X3, X7, X11, X15 as the a output of D3, the b output of D2,
the c output of D1 and the d output of D0; and the first five assignments of
E1 and of E3 for message A.

(b) *The calls.* For every choice of the eight words, the names of steps O, M,
Y and T are the executions of the eleven calls as listed after Table C, each
with its two message words; C0 has first, second, third and fourth value C0.a1,
C0.d1, C0.c1, C0.b1 and outputs (Y0, y, Y8, Y12); and E1.a1, E1.d1, E1.b1,
E1.a2 and E3.h1, E3.g1, E3.f1, E3.e2 are the first, second, fourth and fifth
value of E1 and the second, third, fourth and fifth value of E3 in the
compression of message A.

(c) *The levels.* An outer line is a function of the six words alone. A middle
line is a function of the six words and X2 and does not depend on y. A table
line is a function of the six words and y and does not depend on X2. In
particular the sixteen message words of two trials of one context differ at
most in w8, w9, w10, w11.

(d) *Admissible blocks.* Call a block (w0, .., w15) *admissible* if w4 = W4,
w13 = W13, w14 = w15 = 0 and round 0 on it with block length 55 ends with
(X[3], X[7], X[11], X[15]) equal to the four constants. The map of this section
from the eight words to the block of A is a bijection onto the admissible
blocks.

Proof. (a) is read off the displays, each formula compared with Section 2 and
its call's inputs, outputs and message words; Table C has one name in each of
its 88 cells, all different, and with the eight of E1 and E3 they are the 96.

(b) An assignment solved for one of its terms is an equivalent equation modulo
2^32 (Fact 1), so a line's assignment holds once it has run, and by (a) no
later line changes its names. By (a) and Table C all eight assignments of each
call hold, a constant output in its place (lines D3.b1, X14; D2.b1; D1.c1, X6;
D0.d1, X10) and y as the b output of C0 (line Y8); by Fact 1 the names are the
execution of the call. The E1 and E3 lines are those of 6.2 for message A with
Y11, Y3 of Fact P, run forwards from A's Y1, Y6, Y12, Y4, Y9, Y14.

(c) By induction over the printed order, with (a): an outer line reads only
constants, the six words and outer lines; a middle line in addition only X2
and middle lines; a table line in addition only y and table lines. w6, w7 are
outer and w0..w3, w12 middle lines, w5 is one of the six words, w4, w13, w14,
w15 are constants; only w8..w11 are trial lines.

(d) By (b), round 0 with block length 55 on an output block leaves the state X
of the names, with the constants as X[3], X[7], X[11], X[15], and the pinned
words are constants: the block is admissible. *Injective:* by (b) each of the
eight words is a value in the compression of A, so a function of the block.
*Onto:* the forward values of an admissible block (block length 55) satisfy
every equation of (a): they execute the calls, the constant outputs hold by
admissibility, and C3 has the inputs X3, X7, X11, X15, W4, W13, so Y3, Y11 are
those of Fact P. Run on the eight words taken from them, each line returns the
forward value of its name, by induction, since an assignment has exactly one
solution for any one term given the others. So the lines return the block. QED.

*The same pairs as entry c66f230d.* That entry builds the block of A from the
eight words (vc, vd, S11, S4, X13, X14, w0, y) by 72 lines, the assignments of
the nine calls K0..K3, D0..D3, C0 in another triangular order (its Lemmas S, F
and Y). By the argument of (d) both are bijections onto the same admissible
blocks and B is determined by A: the 2^256 pairs are the same, in another
order; only which of them a run visits, and in which groups, differs. This
remark is not used in any proof below.

*What Lemma T2 does not say.* Eleven of the trial lines are the line for E3.h1
and the ten it depends on (X0, D0.d1, D0.c1, X10, C2.a1, C2.d1, C2.c1, C2.b1,
Y2, Y14). That no order with fewer exists was the answer of a solver in the
search that produced the order; it is not used here and not claimed.
