**6.5 Seven trials in one word.** A packed word holds seven lanes of 36 bits
at bit offsets 0, 36, .., 216. A lane represents its value modulo 2^32; bits
32..35 are carry guards. A constant is placed in all seven lanes before the
batches that use it. Additions are single 256-bit additions. A rotation of
every lane by r is the five operations

    PROR(z, r) = ((z >> r) AND A_r) OR ((z << (32-r)) AND B_r)

with A_r selecting the low 32-r bits of every lane and B_r the next r bits;
the masks discard guard bits and bits shifted in from the neighbouring lane,
so the result is reduced below 2^32. With M = 2^32 - 1 in every lane, the
complement of the low 32 bits of a lane is an XOR with M, a difference
x - y of a constant x and a lane y is (y XOR M) + (x + 1), and subtracting a
constant y is one addition of the constant -y.

The lane layout, seven 36-bit lanes with reduction delayed to the rotations
and a five-operation masked rotation, follows the public ticket 2bf40fb on
this track, which uses it for a birthday search. What is evaluated in the
lanes here is different.
